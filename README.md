# 🛋️ Flipkart Furniture Growth Strategy Deck

## 📌 Overview

This project was created as part of the **PM School Product Challenge**, where I was tasked with designing a comprehensive product strategy to improve the **Flipkart Furniture sales funnel**.

The goal was to identify drop-offs in the awareness → consideration → purchase journey and propose data-driven product solutions to increase conversion, engagement, and revenue.

🏆 **Result:** Secured **2nd Rank** with a score of **95/100**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite Flipkart’s strong brand presence and large customer base, there is a significant drop-off in the furniture purchase funnel due to:

* Lack of dimension clarity and visualization
* Low trust in product quality
* High price sensitivity
* Delivery and tracking uncertainty
* Limited differentiation from competitors (Pepperfry, Urban Ladder, Casa)

The challenge was to design a scalable product strategy to increase sales and user confidence in the furniture category.
